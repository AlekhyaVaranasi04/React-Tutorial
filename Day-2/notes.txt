NPM
npm does not have any full form , it is generally known as node package manager 
Because it manages packages ,but its full form does not stand for node package manager
All different packages,libraries,utilities are included in NPM
when a basic ceate react app is made npm is defaulty there inside it.
 after intializing npm in the project package.json file appears

Package.json
it is a configuration file for the npm keeps a track of what version is being installed

Dependencies->Dev  - development phase required
            ->normal - used in production

Parcel - Dependency as a bunddler so minimize the code and packs the code 
do's many things
-Dev build
-Local server
-HMR = hot module replacement
-File Watchinng Algorithm - keeps a track of every changes through while saving the files and changes in the browser 
-Faster Build -due to chaching
-Image Optimization
-Minification for production
-Bundling
-Compressing 
-Tree shaking remove unusedfiles 

Version range specifiers
'^' - caret allows updates to minor Version
'~' - tilde allows updates directly to majotr versions

Package-Lock.json-> configuration of the exact versions of the dependencies  and transitive dependencies also

The '.gitignore' file is used to put the files that are not neccessay to put in to the git
Node modules is such a huge file it would is not supposed to put the node modules in github ,
because as we have the pcakge and package-lock files we can regenate the node modules by simply typing the command 'npm install'.

npx -> executing a package(parcel)
Fetching react and reactdom from cdn links is not preffered because it is a cost;y operation and also difficult to manage the version 

npx parcel index.html -> development build this command starts the server within 
npx parcel build index.html -> production build
